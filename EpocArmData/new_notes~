				Conclusion No. 1

- EMG must be within a delay of 300ms, therefore EEG could be at double the delay, range,
300ms ~ 600ms, not higher than 2s.

- Make EOG be differentiated from the "Wink Function", as blinking is already not affecting
the wink function.

- IF -> ECG is affecting the measurements on the scalp, ICA must be included to filter out 
the ECG and other noises.

- Change the training method of "wink" for smaller window, as, for each wink a single window, for at least 75 winks, in a single trial, it is much better, therefore,
-- each time a bang/sound is heard, make the wink.
-- window range 0.5 ~ 1.5s {check in a plot the typical lenght of a wink}

- Check the samples that are being overlapped on the SVM system, check if RBF does it naturally
 as k-neighbors does.

- Implement the threshold for the EEG and EMG activation prevention, meaning that:
-- EEG within 100uV maximum, still, find the mean of all the values for relax,concent.
-- EMG {not so sure, it is in the papers, range of mV} find it out through mean of all values.

- To avoid the past point, it may need to implement the ONE vs ALL, over SVM,
ACTIVE vs ALL-NON-ACTIVE, including, EOG, which may need for the actives, to be increased
oversampling them with the found method.

				Conclusion No. 2

- Use >Biofeedback as regular feedback to show the user, the activation, and finished action,
of the current function.

-- Regular Feedback -> Visual and audio action{progress_bar_top+active_sound}
-- Biofeedback	-> Vibrotctil system, on the left and right hand, and dif. parts, for
relax, concentration, Motor Imagery.

- Re-do the alpha system, with the new method of delay activation, entirely.

- After all the work is done, move onto "Mu" work, as it is the "acing on the cake"
1-- Finish the PC work, with no "delay"
2-- move to RPi, and make sure the delay is within the acceptable range of less than 1s.
3-- correction of all the sub-problems on the board, like, from ".py" to ".mat" file and "EDF".
4-- write the first paper as it is need it within the second week of october.
5-- Start the work of the "book" at least the boring parts.
6-- Mu Work.

- Fatigue is already included in the database, as the progression of the trials.
5 small trials for Wink and Alpha, 1 big trial for Concentration.

- create a form for the user to read and sign for the database and trials to be saved and used.
- IF -> Update the RPi system to the latest, Jessie, without damaging the info.

				Conclusion No. 3 {BCI}

- Review all the powerpoint/pdf presentations for that specific subject

- Possible feedback or loop_closure, in my case,
-- when the object is grabbed
-- when the object is put in a specific place
-- when the robot rotates in its different forms.

- Unsupervised Learning Method for Mu, as we do not know what it is appearing in Mu_range
use Kernel Based Method

- Adaptive FIlter can be saved a matrix to be used, or not?

- Search for differences between,   Motor Imagery Movement vs Motor Real Hand Movement

- EDFRead -> Python

- Check Hjort Complexity for Noise{Random} vs Normal_signal

				Conclusion No. 4 {Motor Imagery}

- Kernel for classification for feature selection "unsupervised"
- KRA, MIDKRA "Kernel-based feature relevance"
- database used that is similar for the EPOC is, 
2008 BCI Competition IV -> and they used, zero_mean|8-30Hz (BPF)|60 trials for each MI|
- wavelet was the best on the results for Mu
